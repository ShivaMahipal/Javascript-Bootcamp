/*
    Lesson 5 :- Variable Naming Convention1!
*/

//  Conventions for naming variable:- 
//  1) A variable name can only be made up of letters, numbers and two symbols($, _ ).
let _;
//This is also an example.
let $;
let userName;
let age;
let number1;
let Roll_no;
let user$;
let user_$_person;

// 2) We can not separate words of variables using space. Instead, separate them using an underscore( _ ).
// let my name;
// It can cause an error.

// 3) A variable name should not begin and end with a number.


// 4) When we you are creating an variable and your is having multiple words, you can use "Camel Casing".
// let userName;
// let userAge;

// 5) A variable name should describe the data type or what data it is storing.

// 6) Variable's name are case sensitive.
// Age & age are two different variable's name.
